As external trainers, we typically had one-time workshops with school classes where we agreed on content confidentiality with the teachers. Students could share experiences and ask questions without risking any impact on their grades. This is an extremely privileged approach. Not everyone can afford such a workshop (fortunately partially subsidized in Vienna), and teachers who address the topic themselves will always - regardless of how relaxed their relationship with students is - be in a position of authority.",

            text2: "Generally, with a non-judgmental approach, the biggest challenge is to avoid judging what students share while simultaneously putting their statements into context to help young people construct a value framework they can orient themselves by. Here are two examples of how to add context without judgment:",
            quote1: "Yes, drinking alcohol is normalized in our society. I drink alcohol sometimes too. That doesn't change the fact that it's an addictive substance.",
            quote2: "You're not the first teenager, and certainly won't be the last, to drink alcohol at your age. Alcohol is appealing, and the state even profits when we start drinking young. Youth is a time for experimentation, and if you ask your parents, they might have some stories to tell from their younger years. Just be aware that alcohol can be addictive and can particularly harm you during your development.",
            text3: "As much as we'd like to have more influence. The reality is that young people will drink whether we demonize alcohol or not. At the same time, it's hypocritical. Which adult hasn't been completely drunk at least once?",
            text4: "When taking a non-judgmental approach, it's important to be careful not to inadvertently glorify alcohol consumption. There's a small but important difference between '...and if you ask your parents, they might have some stories to tell from their younger years' versus '...and if you ask your parents, they might have some funny stories to tell from their younger years.'",
            text5: "In one version, we clarify society's hypocritical relationship with alcohol. In the second version, we make this relationship desirable and idealize it - after all, who doesn't want to experience and tell something funny?"

            text2: "Therefore, it's particularly important that we as educators consciously and clearly state when phones should be put away and when they can be picked up again. Generally speaking: Once they have their phones in hand, 80% won't listen to you anymore. Whenever you want full attention, have them put their phones away."

            instructions3: "Give them some time to play around with it - when you click on different areas in the diagram, you get an explanation of what happens at which blood alcohol level. To finish, feel free to escalate with them by virtually drinking yourself into a coma and see who reaches 3.5 per mille first when drinking the same drinks at the same time (spoiler: it will be the smallest girls who 'win').",
            note: "Important: Tell them that this isn't a tool to actually track how many per mille they have, as absorption also depends a lot on food intake, which the underlying Widmark formula doesn't account for."
